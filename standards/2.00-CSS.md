## Formatting

All CSS documents must use two spaces for indentation and files should have no trailing whitespace. Other formatting rules:

``` css
.media {
  overflow: hidden;
  color: #fff;
  background-color: #000;
}

.media img {
  float: left;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
}

.media .content {
  background: #FFF;
}
```


## Naming

All ids, classes and attributes must be lowercase with hyphens used for separation.

``` css
/* Sample Code */
.media {
  overflow: hidden;
  color: #fff;
}
```

## Foundation

Use frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation to accelerate the development of your project. Expand those frameworks to fit your project needs. 


## Grid System

The  grid  system ([Bootstrap Example](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid)) is an aid, not a guarantee. It permits a number of possible uses and each designer can  look  for a solution appropriate to his personal style. But one must learn how to use the grid; it is an art that requires practice.



## Object-Oriented CSS

How  do you scale CSS for thousands of pages? Object Oriented CSS is an answer. It's an approach for writing  CSS  that's  fast, maintainable, and standards-based. It adds much needed predictability to CSS so that even beginners can participate in writing beautiful websites.
